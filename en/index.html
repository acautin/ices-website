            <p class="col">
                ICES (stands for the Spanish version of Chilean Researchers in Switzerland) is a non-profit association
                formed by a group of researchers, academics, students and professionals who develop their respective
                activities in Switzerland, interested in the collaboration between Chile and Switzerland in every field
                of knowledge and research.

            <p class="h3">What Motivates ICES</p>
            <p class="col">
                ICES seeks to contribute to the academic and professional collaboration between Chile and Switzerland.
                Based on our academic and professional experiences in Switzerland, we believe that there are many
                opportunities for scientific and professional collaboration between institutions of these two countries.
                We think that the academic, professional and even personal life of the Chilean researchers in
                Switzerland can profit from the advices and past experiences of people who are already working in this
                country. Our main motivation is to create the opportunities for Chilean researchers in Switzerland to
                contact each other, interchange experiences and explore new academic challenges together with Chilean
                and Swiss organizations. Also, we want to be an information platform in order to facilitate the exchange
                of Chilean students in Switzerland.
